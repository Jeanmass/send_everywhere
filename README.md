# Send Everywhere

Exercice from my NodeJS course in college. 


### Objective

I hade to write a simple app that allows a user to send the same message over email, twitter, Facebook and Slack. Every message has to be saved in a text file with the time.


### Credits

The HTML/CSS is based on a free template from CodePen. I modified it to make it more responsive. <br>
